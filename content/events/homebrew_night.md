Hi everyone!

Perhaps you have at one point been looking at the homebrew page of D&D Beyond and thought 'I can do better'. Well, we give you the opportunity to do so! On Monday 25/03 we organise a homebrew night where you can make your own monsters and items. At the end of this event, you can even pit your creations against others in our Arena.

Registering can be done through the following link: https://forms.gle/p9ZSXRkssKk6iek66
