Join us for a D&D 101 evening where you can learn the basics of D&D or just join a fun game! Whether you are a seasoned adventurer or a complete beginner, you are welcome at this event.

The best way to learn is by doing, so after a short introduction we'll play a fun oneshot! There is also the possibility to try your hand at DM.

More info will follow soon.
