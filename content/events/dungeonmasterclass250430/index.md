Hear ye! hear ye!

The court summons all prospective and experienced Dungeon Masters alike! Harken the Lord of our glorious union as he tells of great strategy and wonderful creativity. Then claim thy seat at our round table such that all may teach and in turn learn from thee the noble art of DMing.

This event is aimed at initiating newbies as well as further honing the skills of veterans. After a presentation   with basic dos and don'ts of DMing, everyone will be invited to join a round table discussion where you can ask questions and give advice to your colleagues. Feel free to leave us some questions to prepare in advance.

We will meet in the eve of the 30th of April at 7PM at JHP 00.46, Minderbroederstraat 8, Leuven. 
Registration for this event is required.
