Hey everyone, our craft night is in sight! The perfect opportunity to learn how to paint your very own miniatures for D&D, Pathfinder, Warhammer or any miniature based tabletop games. Don't be scared to have some happy accidents as you will be explained the basic techniques needed and provided with the needed brushes and paint to complete your (first) miniature. The event will take place Wednesday 4/12.
