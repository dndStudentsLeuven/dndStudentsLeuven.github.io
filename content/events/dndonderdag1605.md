Hey there adventurer,

The exams are getting a bit closer, and perhaps you are tired of being forced to do your excercises and having to know all kinds of theory by heart. So we give you the option to do this of your own volition as well! What better place to solve difficult math problems (and in the worst case, train your improv) than in one of our monthly oneshots?

Every third Thursday of the month, we reserve a room where everyone is welcome to play D&D. It doesn't matter if you have our own group already or are looking for one, whether you are an experienced player or more of a newbie in the world of D&D. If you want you can also register as a Dungeon Master and then we will fix you up with a group.

So we welcome you on Thursday 16/05 from 19h30 onwards to come join us for some games in MSI room 01.23 .

See you all there!
