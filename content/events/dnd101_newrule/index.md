Gather round, adventurers! 🐉 The first D&D 101 of this year will revolve around the new 2024 player's handbook ruleset! 📜 Discover the intricacies of the new ruleset, as well as what has stayed the same in comparison to the previous edition.

The best way to learn is by doing, so after a short introduction we'll play a oneshot using the new ruleset! There is also the possibility to try your hand at DMing this new ruleset.

Registrations for both players and DM's are required. We hope to see you there!
