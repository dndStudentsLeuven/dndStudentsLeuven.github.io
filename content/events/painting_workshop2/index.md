In our newest edition of our painting workshops we'll once again tackle the basic techniques needed to paint your very own mini. Different this time is that we also offer advanced techniques for people with a little more experience ðŸ’Ž .
During our workshop we'll teach you how to paint a miniature that you'll be able to take home by the end of the evening which you can proudly display wherever and to whoever you want ðŸ¤© !

The techniques we'll be covering are: Basecoating, using Washes and Drybrushing. For those who are feeling adventurous we also offer optional instructions on edge highlights, layering and glazing âœ¨ .
