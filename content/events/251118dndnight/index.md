Ready for adventure? Our D&Dinsdag one-shot evenings are the perfect way to dive into an exciting Dungeons & Dragons story — without the long-term campaign commitment!

New players and seasoned DMs are equally welcome at our events. Do you already have a party assembled and don’t need a group or DM, and are just looking for a space to play? You’re more than welcome to join us too! Don’t forget to register using the link below.

📅 When: 18th of November at 19h

📍 Where: QDV 140 (**It’s a different campus: Arenberg 3**)

🎟️ What to bring: Some writing utensils and dice (we have spare ones if you don’t have dice)

✒️ Registrations: For both players and DMs through the website in bio

New characters, new stories, and new friends await. Will you be the hero of the evening? Join us, roll initiative, and find out!
