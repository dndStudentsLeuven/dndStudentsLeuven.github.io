There are truths out there that were never meant for us to know. About the stars. About our thoughts, our origins. Why we dream of things we’ve never seen in deep, dark corners of reality. 
Our beliefs soothe, yet blind us. Our science empowers us, but... nature is never kind. 
And beneath the surface of it all… something watches. Something ancient, and indifferent.

Welcome to Call of Cthulhu.
You’re an ordinary person, stumbling into the incomprehensible.
You won’t save the world. You’ll be lucky to survive it. 
Or die before the madness sets in.

The investigation will begin monday, 5th of may, in JHP 00.46 at 19:00
