In our newest edition of our painting workshops we'll once again tackle the basic techniques needed to paint your very own mini. On top of that we'll also explain you the basics of color theory and how the methods we explain help you achieve your vision for your mini.
During our workshop we'll teach you how to paint a miniature that you'll be able to take home by the end of the evening which you can proudly display wherever and to whoever you want!
The techniques we'll be covering are: Basecoating, using Washes and Drybrushing. With some more advanced techniques like glazing explained to the people who are interested in trying it.

This event will take place the 26th of Februari at 8pm, location:  MSI 01.20
