Hey there adventurer,

Every third Tuesday of the month, we reserve a room where everyone is welcome to play D&D. It doesn't matter if you have our own group already or are looking for one, whether you are an experienced player or more of a newbie in the world of D&D. If you want you can also register as a Dungeon Master and then we will fix you up with a group.

So we welcome you on Tuesday 17/12 to join us for some games!

See you all there!

Not yet open for registration.
