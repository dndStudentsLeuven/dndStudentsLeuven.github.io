Greetings, the time has come for another D&D Tuesday!

📅 When: 9th of December at 19h 

📍 Where: JHP 00.46  (Leuven)

🎟️ What to bring: Some writing utensils and dice (we have spare ones if you don’t have dice)

We provide the location, DM, character sheets and even some dice.
All you have to do is register using the form below and we'll get you grouped to a party and ready to play.

Need a location to play with your friends but don't need a DM? Just indicate that you don't need us to provide you with a DM and we'll get you your own table.

The one-shot will be played at 3rd level and we will group you in parties of 4-5 players. If you want you can bring your own character sheets. An effort will be made as well to group you by preferred rule set for those who just learned the new rules or those that want to try it out. Note however that no dedicated explanation will be provided beforehand (though your DM will be more than happy to explain things when needed).

For those who wish to play at a higher level please indicate so in the notes section, in that case we will try to team you up with people that want to play at the same level!
