To allow you to broaden your ttrpg horizons, we will organise a World of Darkness evening this semester.

The World of Darkness is much like our own, the countries, buildings, the colruyt you know (and love?). However, behind this mundane world, the supernatural hides. That night shop might be operated by a vampire hoping to slake their hunger on someone desperate for a midnight snack. That flat no one rents longer than 2 months might be haunted by ghosts trying to stop their home from being defiled. Maybe the appearance of that strange star could be the herald of an ancient weapon being deployed again?

For this event, we will play Hunter: the Reckoning.

In Hunter: the Reckoning, you play as a Hunter. Hunters are humans who learned of the supernatural and, for their own reasons, decided to hunt it. They might hunt because they want to free humanity from the evils that lurk in the shadows, out of morbid curiosity, to take revenge, etc.

We hope to see you on the hunt...
