Hey there adventurer,

Have you settled well into the new year? The summer vacation might've made your thinking skills a bit rusty, so what better place to refresh your math (and in the worst case, train your improv) than in one of our monthly oneshots?

Every third Tuesday of the month, we reserve a room where everyone is welcome to play D&D. It doesn't matter if you have our own group already or are looking for one, whether you are an experienced player or more of a newbie in the world of D&D. If you want you can also register as a Dungeon Master and then we will fix you up with a group.

So we welcome you on Tuesday 15/10 to join us for some games!

See you all there!

Not yet open for registration.
