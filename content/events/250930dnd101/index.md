Gather 'round, adventurers! 

What better opportunity to get into Dungeons and Dragons then the beginning of the year. The best way to learn is by doing, so after a short introduction into how to play the game we'll play a fun oneshot together. New fans or experienced veterans welcome!

We welcome you on 19h at JHP 00.46.
