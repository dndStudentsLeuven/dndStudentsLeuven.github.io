At D&D Leuven we're on a mission to make the world of tabletop role-playing games (TTRPGs) more accessible to students in Leuven and to foster connections among enthusiasts. Whether you're a seasoned game master, a passionate player, or just dipping your toes into the realm of TTRPGs, there's a place for you here.

Our community organizes a range of activities tailored to every kind of adventurer:
- D&D 101: Designed for beginners, our D&D 101 sessions offer a crash course on the game system. Afterwards, we dive straight into the action with a thrilling one-shot adventure.
- Monthly TTRPG night: Whether you have your own adventuring party or you're flying solo, we provide a space for you to join a game, meet new players, and embark on unforgettable quests.
- Craft nights and homebrew sessions: From crafting intricate miniatures to devising your own rules and settings, these events offer endless opportunities to personalize your TTRPG adventures.
- Introduction to other game systems: Venture beyond the realms of D&D and explore a diverse array of game systems, including Pathfinder, Call of Cthulhu, and more.
- Cantus: Raise your tankard and join us for a merry evening of singing, laughter, and camaraderie at our legendary cantus gatherings. Celebrate the spirit of adventure with fellow TTRPG enthusiasts as we toast to friendship, where the true magic of TTRPGs lies.

Together, let's roll the dice, tell unforgettable stories, and create memories that will last a lifetime. Ready to join the adventure? Get in touch or come to one of our events!
